## Chapter 1 : Introduction

- **database-management system (DBMS)** = a collection of data and programs to access data, goal: *convenience, efficiency*
- **database** = the collection of data

### 1.1 Database-System Applications
 
 There are many examples of databases: enterprise information, banking and finance, universities, airlines, telecommunication

### 1.2 Purpose of Database Systems

 - **file-processing system** = conventional operating system pre-DBMSs, stores permanent records in various files.
    - this requires other programs to extract records, add records, and find appropriate files
    - *Major Disadvantages:*
        1. Data reduncdancy and inconsistency - 
            files have different structures, programs in different languages,
            data may be duplicated across files, 
            disagreement: data changed in one file but not another (!data inconsistency)
        2. Difficulty in accessing data -
            whenever data needs to be accessed, a new program has to be written if it does not already exist,
            the file might be read over and over again,
            not efficient or convenient
        3. Data isolation -
            data scattered across files with different formats makes retrieval programs difficult
        4. Integrity problems -
            difficult to add new consistency constraints,
            hardcode constraints across different applications
        5. Atomicity problems -
            data change must be atomic: happen in entirety or not at all
        6. Concurrent-access anomalies - 
            for performance, systems allow multiple users to update data but this can lead to inconsistent data with file systems
        7. Security problems -
            not all users should be able to access all data,
            programs for file-processing systems added ad hoc makes security constraints difficult

### 1.3 View of Data

 Major purpose provide users with abstract view (hide certain details about how data stored and maintained).

#### Data Abstraction

##### with the following example:
    type instructor = record
            ID : char (5);
            name : char (20);
            dept_name : char (20);
            salary : numeric (8,2);
        end;
    

 - Physical Level: describes *how* data is stored

        ex. records are stored in consecutive storage, how the compiler accesses the ID, name, dept_name, salary, etc.

 - Logical Level: describes *what* data is stored

        ex. for example, may have more than one record such as a classes record - this level concerns the relations, databases, etc.

 - View Level: describes only *part* of database
    
        ex. a guest may only see name and dept_name, other instructors may only see ID, name, dept_name but not salary, etc. there are many different possible views

**physical data independence** = someone working on the logical level does not need to know how the compiler formats data, database admins do not need to know the complexity of the physical level


#### Instances and Schemas

**Instance** is the collection of data at a moment. **Schema** is the overall design of the database. **Physical schema** describes database at physical level, **logical schema** describes at logical level, **subschemas** are the different views.

**Physical data independence** = the logical schema does not depend on the physical schema so if the physical changes, the logical does not. Note: logical schema is "by far the most important, in terms of its effect on application programs"

#### Data Models

**Data Model** = underlying structure of database, conceptual tools to describe data, relationships, semantics, etc.

Four types:
    1. Relational Model - collection of tables (aka relations) to represent data,
    record-based model,
    most widely used data model,
    strict data constraints with attributes and fields
    2. Entity-Relationship Model - akak E-R data model, uses collection of basic objects (entities) and relationships among objects
    3. Object-Based Data Model - extending E-R with encapsulation, methods and object identity,
    object-relational data model combines this with relational data model
    4. Semistructured Data Model - permits specification of data where individual data items of the same type may have different attributes
    5. etc. - network data model, hierarchial data model

#### Database Languages

**data-definition language** = specify database schema, **data-manipulation language** = express database queries & updates

SQL is both

Data-Manipulation Language:
- enables users to retrieve, insert, delete, modify data
    - Procedural DMLs: specify *what* data needed and *how* to get data
    - Declarative DMLs: require user to specify *what* data is without specifying how
- abstraction of DML for declarative

Data-Definition Language:
