### CMSC424 Class Notes
#### Kaitlyn Yang | March 1st, 2021


**Exam**
- covers everything before functional dependencies
- single question to write an SQL query; should have assignment two open to test it
- two or three questions to draw pictures: one of E-R diagram and one to write a relational algebra expression
- look for quizzes on gradescope and homework assignments to study

#### BCNF may not preserve dependencies
- only makes sure it is not lossless

ex.
R = {J,K,L} ; F = {JK->L, L->K}
Two candidate keys = JK and JL, R is not in BCNF
but any decomposition of R will fail to preserve JK->L

- not always possible to find a dependency preserving decomposition that is in BCNF


**Prime Attributes**
- an attribute that is contained in a candidate key for R

ex.
R={A,B,C,D,E,H}, F = {A->BC, E->HA}
Candidate keys = {ED} (bc neither E or D itself is sufficient, D needs to be there bc D->D)
Prime attributes: D,E

ex. 2
R={J,K,L}, F={JK->L, L->K}
Candidate keys = {JK, JL}
Prime attributes: J,K,L

Observation:
- A key has no redundancy (is not repeated in a relation)
- A prime attribute has limited redundancy

#### 3NF
- Given a relation schema and a set of functional dependencies F if every FD, &alpha;->&beta; is either:
    - trivial or
    - &alpha; is a superkey of R or
    - all attributes in (&beta;-&alpha;) are prime

- lossless
- preserves dependencies
- limited redundancy

Why does redundancy arise:
- Given a FD, &alpha; -> &beta;, if &alpha; is repeated (&beta;-&alpha;) has to be repeated
    - if rule 1 is satisfied, (&beta;-&alpha;) is empty so not a problem
    - if rule 2 is satisfied, &alpha; can't be repeated so this doesn't happen either
    - if not, rule three says (&beta;-&alpha;) must contain only prime attributes
- this allows some redundancy but not all
- it is good because there is always a lossless, dependency preserving decomp

example:

R = {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H}
F = {A->CGH, AD->C, DE->F, G->H}
candidate key = {ABDE} * can not be produced, can recreate anything else, ADE are never on the right hand side, B is never mentioned

- R<sub>1</sub>={ACGH}
- R<sub>2</sub>={ADC}
- R<sub>3</sub>={DEF}
- ~~R<sub>4</sub>={GH}~~ (is in R1)
- R<sub>5</sub>={ABDE}

canonical cover: F' = {A->CGH, AD->C, DE->F, G->H}
= {A->CG, DE->F, G->H} (Hi s extra in A->CGH, D extra in AD->C, merge A->C into A->CG)
= {A->CG, DE->F, G->H}

becomes 

- R<sub>1</sub>={ACG}
- R<sub>2</sub>={DEF}
- R<sub>3</sub>={GH}
- R<sub>5</sub>={ABDE}

#### BCNF and redundancy
- FDs rule out certain tuples, MVDs require tubles of certain form
- would not be on test

#### Database Design Process
Three ways to come up with a schema
1. Using E/R Diagram *recommended*
2. A universal relation R that contains all attributes
3. An ad hoc schema that is then normalized

#### Recap
1NF
- Essentially no set valued attributes
- Formally a domain is called atomic if the elements of the domain are considered indivisible
- A schema is in 1NF if the domains of all attributes are atomic
- Generally assumed 1NF

2NF
- historical

Denormalization
- After doing normalization we may have too many tables
- We may denormalize for performance reasons or creating views instead of using joins
- Can also use more advanced normal forms (but BCNF/3NF/4NF are the most common and useful)

- 10 T/F, 5 short answer
- 1 SQL equation
- create an E/R diagram (upload picture)
- relational algebra
- 90 minutes
