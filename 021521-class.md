### CMSC424 Class Notes

**Terms**
- Monotonic queries: does not lose tuples as more data arrives (streaming queries)
- Table functions: returns a set of tuples, used anywhere a table is used

### QUIZ 3
- 2. ((NULL=10) is unknown) --> results to `true`
- 9. "Select A, max(B) from R" --> does not work because there is no groupby for A, mixing scalar and non-scalar functions making it invalid
- 12. Assume a table of all null. For 1. If all are null, then nothing is returned (null is not > 1, results in unknown). However for 2. the except returns nothing therefore the select returns the entire table again
- 15. --look for the image of the answer on whiteboard lol

### Entity-Relationship Model
Two key concepts:
1. Entities
    - an object that exists, distinguishable
    - have attributes
    - form entity sets which may overlap
2. Relationships
    - relationships between 2 or more entities
    - form relationship sets with other relationships of the same type with same properties

Relationship Cardinalities
- requires looking at the domain, need to represent this
    - ex. being able to open one acct vs multiple acct
- "how many other entities that an entity in a diff table can map to"
- want to define in database

**this is not how e-r diagrams are actually made but as a reference**

[ ]--[ ]--[ ]: many to many
[ ]<-[ ]->[ ]: one to one
[ ]<-[ ]--[ ]: one to many (sec attr maps to more than one attr)

Types of Attributes:
- Single vs Composites:
    - are parts accessed separately or together?
    - data bases assume accessing columns is atomic
    - using composite may lose data later on
    - i.e.ng redundancy, enforcing constraint accessing first and last names from "name" is composite

- Singled-valued vs Multi-valued
    - i.e. phone numbers are multi-valued

- Derived
    - i.e. if date of birth is present, age can be derived
    - usually a function
    - can help in avoidis, etc.

### Entity Keys
Keys:
- set of attributes that describe an entity
- i.e. customer -> {customer_id}, {customer_name, customer_city, customer_street}, etc.

Review/types of keys:
- Superkey = any attribute set unique to entities
- Candidate key = minimal superkey, removing an attribute will make it no longer a key
- Primary key = candidate key chosen as the key by DBA

* the primary key is underlined in a e-r diagram

### Relationship Set Keys
- How to identify relationships completely and uniquely
- Ways to do it:
    - A relationship set made of the primary keys in relations

- also has candidate keys
- for example: "has" relationship - is {cust-id, access-date, account-number} a candidate key for *has*
    - Answer no: access date not necessary
    - **the union of the primary keys is always a super key**
- whether {cust-id, account-number} is a candidate key changes based on relationship cardinality
- for example: if an account maps to only one customer, just listing the account will be enough

- General rule for set keys:
    - one-to-one: primary key of *either* entity set
    - one-to-many: primary key of the entity set on the many side
    - many-to-many: union of primary keys of the associate entity sets
- primary keys of entity sets form super key of relationship set but it means **entity pair must have at most one relationship in a relationship set**
- must consider mapping cardinality of relationship set when identifying candidate keys

### E-R Diagrams
- entity sets of relationships do not need to be distinct
- can map back to itself with "roles"

ex.
instructor <--<one-to-one>--> student
instructor <--<one-to-many>-- student "one instructor teaches many students"
instructor --<many-to-many>-- student "an instructor teaches multiple student, student have multiple instructors"

**Participation**
- total participation; denoted with a double line ==
    - every section MUST have a relationship
    - course <--[sec_course]==section
        - all sections MUST have a course
        - but not all courses have to have a section (not this semester, etc.)

- partial participation; single lines
- alternatively, can write it with numbers "0..*" partial to many, "1..1" one to one

- cardinality Constraints particularly for ternary relationships

**Weak Entity Sets**
- an entity set w/o a primary key is a "weak entity set"
- existence depends on the existence of identifying entity set
    - multiple one-to-many relationship set
    - weak side must be a total
    - denote with double diamond around identifying relationship
- discriminator/partial key is the set of attributes that help distinguish it among all the entities of a weak entity set
- primary key of weak entity set is formed by the primary key of the strong entity set on which it is existent-dependent + weak entity set's discriminator

### Redundant Attributes
- suppose we have entity sets:
    - instructor with dept_name
    - department
- and a relationship
    - inst_dept relating instructor and department
- fix is removing dept_name from instructor

### KEY for E-R Diagrams
**attributes of entity**
- Underlined: primary key
- Dashed lined: discriminator key
- { }: multivalued
- (): derived
- indented: composite values

**sets**
- rectangle: entity set
- diamond: relationship set
- double diamond: relationship set for weak entity set

**relationships**
- double line: total participation on entity set
- single line: many-to relationship
- directed line: one-to relationship
- numbers on line: cardinality limits
- words on line: role-name, role indicator

### Reduction to Relation Schemas (introduction)
- Going from E-R diagrams back to relations
- A strong entity set reduces to a schema with the same attributes
- a weak entity set becomes a table that includes a foreign key for the primary key of the identifying strong entity set
- representing relationship sets is the minimal key for the relationship
