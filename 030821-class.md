#### Data Storage
##### How/Where to store data, how to access it

#### Query Processing/Storage

user query v, results ^

- Query Processing Engine
    - given an input user query, decide how to execute it
    - sequence of pages to be brought in memory
    - operate upon tuples to produce results

page requests v, pointers to pages ^

- Buffer Management
    - bringing pages from disk to memory
    - managaging the limited memory

block requests v, data ^

- Space Management on Persistent Storage (e.g. Disks)
    - storage hierarchy
    - how relations mapped to files
    - how tuples mapped to disk blocks

#### Storage Hierarchy
- Tradeoffs between spped and cost of access
- `Volatile` (loses content when power switched off) vs non-volatile
- sequential (read the data continously i.e. select * from employee) vs random access (read data from anywhere at any time i.e. select * from employee where name like '_a_b')

- with new speeds of networks, SSDs, and high memories the tradeoffs have shifted but volume of data is also growing
- the higher you go in the pyramid of memory, the more costly per byte (speed vs cost of access)

**Cache:** Fast, volatile, typically on chip
**Main Memory:** 10's or 100's of nanoseconds, volatile, cheap and dropping
**Flash Memory:** Limited number of write/erase cycles, non-volatile but slower than main memory esp for writes
**Hard Drive/Magnetic Disk:** Non-volatile, sequential access much faster than random access, think the spinny bois

**Storage**
- Primary: main memory, cache; typically volatile and fast
- Secondary: disks; Solid State Drives (SSD); non-volatile
- Tertiary: tapes; non-volatile, super cheap, slow

aw shit i stopped paying attention ok uh search up RAID levels it's about how the blocks are distributed
