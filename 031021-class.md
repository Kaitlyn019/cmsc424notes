### CMSC424 Class Notes

#### RAID
*persistent storage*
- raid levels have different things, something about disks and attempting to keep data

**RAID level 5**
- distributed parity blocks instead of bits
- normal operation: read directly from disk, write to read and update parity block


#### Buffer Manager

- When the QP wants a block it asks the buffermanager for the block of memory to operate on
- if block in memory - return a pointer; if not, evict a current page by writing it to a temporary storage or throwing it away, making a request to the storage subsystem to fetch it

**Replacement Policy - what page to throw out**
- LRU: least recently used page
- MRU: most recently used page
    - particularly good for large arrays
- Clock: an efficent implementation of LRU

- pinning a block: not allowed to evict
- force output/force write: forcing content of block to disk
