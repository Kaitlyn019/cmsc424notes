### Reduction to Relational Schemas
translating E-R diagrams to a relational schema

the big goal is being able to eliminate any redundancy: many to one, one to many, many to many 
- can be represented by the primary key of the many side
- total participation is important for nulls! it means that the attribute can't have a null value
- for one-to-one relationship sets, either side can be chosen to act as the "many side" = extra attribute can be added to either table


**ER Diagram to Relational Schema**
1. Schema per entity set
    - expand composite attributes to become full attributes
    - new schema for multi-valued
    - drop derived attributes for now
2. Schema per relationship set
*look over slides*
3. optimize
    - if you can get less tables, not a bad idea
    - copy one side to many side, make one entity set ; no need for relationship set
    - basically try to make it so that the relationship set is a subset of the entity set
    - get rid of most relationship sets

### Design Issues
- Binary versus n-ary relationship sets
    - i.e. relationship between more than two entity sets
    - some relationships that appear non-binary may be represented using binary relationships
- converting non-binary relationships to binary form
    - any non-binar can be prerepsented in binary by creating an artificial entity set
    - replace R between entity sets A-B-C by an entity set E, R_A, R_B, R_C, relating E with A-B-C
    - create a special identifying attribute for E
    - add any attributes of R to E


going from:

     A                         A
     |                         |
     |                        R_A
B -- R -- C   to  B -- R_B --  E -- R_C -- C

*lmao look at slides*
