### Relational, E-R, and Decomposition

- Smaller Schemas:
    - not necessarily good; requires more joins
    - harder to check for some dependencies
    - reason why decomposition is not always good

- lossy decomposition
    - we lose some constraints or information

**Things we want/Desiderata:**
- correct and faithful to original desgin
- as little redundancy as possible
- no "inability to represent information"; nulls shouldn't be required to store information
- dependency preservation - should be able to check for constraints

### Functional Dependencies
- closures, candidate keys, canonical covers, armstrong axioms

Approach:
1. Encode and list all our knowledge about the schema
    - functional dependencies (FDs)
    - attributes on the left hand side can determine attribute on the right hand side
2. Define a set of rules the schema must follow to be good
    - normal forms
    - each normal form specifies constraints on schemas and FDs
3. If not in a "normal form", we modify the schema

= check notes from chapter 7

**simple algorithm for closure**
1. start with &beta;=&alpha;
2. Go over all functional dependencies s->y, in *F*<sup>+</sup>
3. If s &subset; &beta; then add y to &beta;
4. repeat till &beta; stops changing

closure of two; just combine the closure of the individuals

**Extraneous Attributes**
- Extraneous attributes that can be safely removed from *either* side of the functional dependency
- &sigma; is extraneous in &alpha; if
    - &sigma; is in &alpha;
    - *F* logically implies F'
    - let y = &alpha; - &sigma; then show y<sup>+</sup> includes &beta; under *F*
    - *iff*:
        - (&alpha; - &sigma;)<sup>+</sup> inclues &beta; under *F*
- &sigma; is extraneous in &beta; if
    - &sigma; is in &beta; and
    - *F*' logically implies *F*
