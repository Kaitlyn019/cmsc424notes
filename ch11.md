## Chapter 11: Indexing and Hashing

### 11.1 Basic Concepts
Two basic types of indices:
1. Ordered indices - based on a sorted ordering of the values
2. Hash indices - based on a uniform distribution of values across a range of buckets, assigned by a hash function

Each technique cares about access types, access time, insertion time, deletion time, and space overhead

### 11.2 Ordered Indices

- index structure to gain fast random access, each index structure associated with a particular search key
- if the file contains the record is sequentially ordered, clustering index is an index whose search key also defines the sequential order of the file (aka primary indices)

**Dense and Sparse Indices**

- An index consists of a search-key value and pointers to one or more records that value as their search-key value
- the pointer is an identifier of the disk block and offset to get record
Two types of ordered indicies:
- `Dense Index` - an index entry appears for every search key value on file
    - index record contains search-key value and a pointer to the first data record and the rest are stored sequentially after the first record
    - records are sorted on the same search key
- `Sparse Index` - index entry appears for only some of the search-key values
    - only if relation is stored in sorted order of the search key (clustering index)
    - to locate find index entry with largest search-key value less than or equal to the value being looked for and follow pointers

- faster to locate record with dense, less space to use sparse, less maintenance for insertions and deletions for sparse

**Multilevel Indices**
- dense index on a relation with lots of records, index itself is incredibly large
- with a small one it fits in main memory with a low search time but large index, does not fit in main memory
- treat index as any other sequential file, sparse outer index of the original index


### 11.3 B<sup>+</sup>-Tree Index Files

the disadvantage to the method listed above is it degrades as the file grows for index lookups and sequential scans of the data, requires frequent reorganizations

- the `B<sup>+</sup>-tree` is a balanced tree where every path from root to leaf is the same length
- each nonleaf node of the tree has between &LeftCeiling;n/2&RightCeiling; and n children
- imposes performance overhead on insertion and deletion which is a good tradeoff when avoiding file reorganization, there is also overhead of wasted space if they have the minimum number of children

**Structure of a B<sup>+</sup>-Tree**
- multilevel index with up to n-1 search-key values and n pointers, and search-key values within a node are kept in a sorted order
- `leaf nodes` values do not overlap except for duplicate search-key values, each leaf can hold up to n-1 values
- `nonleaf/internal nodes` form a sparse index on the leaf nodes

**Updates on B<sup>+</sup>-Tree**
- indices on the relation must be updated correspondingly
- insertion and deletion are more complicated than lookup bc necessary to split a node tat becomes too large or coalesce nodes

- `insertion` - same technique as lookup to find leaf node, insert an entry, position it such that the searchkeys are still in order
- `deletion` - lookup to find the leaf node containing the entry to be deleted, 


### 11.3 B<sup>+</sup>-Tree Extensions

**Indexing Strings**
- two problems for string valued attributes:
1. strings can be of variable length
2. strings can be long, leading to a low fanout and a correspondingly increased tree height
- a node must be split if its full and there is no space for a new entry, nodes can be merged or entries redistributed instead of being based on the max # of entries that the node can hold
- `prefix compression` - do not store the entire search key value at nonleaf nodes and instead the search key value that is sufficent to distinguish between the key values in the subtrees that it separates
